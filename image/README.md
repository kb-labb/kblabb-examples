# Image examples


## Installation

Install conda environment named `kblabb-examples-image` using [environment.yml](https://github.com/kb-labb/kblabb-examples/blob/master/image/environment.yml) file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate the environment and install the rest of the packages in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Head over to the folder annotation/ and start running the scripts!
N.B. In a few scripts the code is pointing to a txt file with a password. The user should change this path to point to their credentials.txt file that should contain the password.
